Chantel Wetzel is a Mathematical Statistician in the FRAM Population Ecology Program at the Northwest Fisheries Science Center in Seattle, WA. I conduct stock assessments for U.S. West Coast groundfish stocks.  My research focuses on developing stock assessment approaches, methods to improve data processing for assessments, and evaluating assessment results.
